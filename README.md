# GENESIS: G-ADRS Rigidity Layer

## The GENESIS Canon
The GENESIS Project is centered on the principle that **Ability binds Explainability × Executability × Stability**.

* **Explainability**: High-level mathematical proofs resolving obstructions to singularity in the 3D Navier–Stokes equations.
* **Executability**: High-performance computational simulations (N=65,536+) validating theoretical manifolds.
* **Stability**: A "Volatility Firewall" designed for systemic risk management in financial and physical systems.

## Current Research Focus
* **Primary**: An Information-Resolved Obstruction to Singularity in the 3D Navier–Stokes Equations.
* **Datasets**: Validated against Numerai v5.0 Rain and Graph-Foam MVP simulations.
* **Applications**: Systemic risk modeling for reinsurance (Swiss Re/Munich Re).

## Local Development
This repository uses an SSH-based workflow for secure data transmission and an active `.gitignore` to prevent large dataset bloat.
